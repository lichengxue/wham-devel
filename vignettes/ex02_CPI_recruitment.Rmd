In this vignette we walk through an example using the `wham` (WHAM = Woods Hole Assessment Model) package to run a state-space age-structured stock assessment model. WHAM is a generalization of code written for [Miller et al. (2016)](https://doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2015-0339) and [Xu et al. (2018)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/fog.12236), and in this example we apply WHAM to the same stock, Southern New England / Mid-Atlantic Yellowtail Flounder. 

This is the 2nd `wham` example, which builds off model `m4` from example 1 (full state-space model, numbers at all ages are random effects, logistic normal age-compositions). We assume you already have `wham` installed. If not, see the [Introduction](https://timjmiller.github.io/wham/). The simpler 1st example, without environmental effects, is available as a [R script](https://github.com/timjmiller/wham/blob/master/inst/example_scripts/ex1_basics.R) and [vignette](https://timjmiller.github.io/wham/articles/ex1_basics.html).

In example 2, we demonstrate how to specify and run WHAM with varying

- recruitment models (random, Bev-Holt, Ricker)

- environmental covariate (Cold Pool Index, CPI) process models (random walk, AR1), and

- how the CPI affects recruitment (controlling or limiting)

As in [example 1](https://timjmiller.github.io/wham/articles/ex1_basics.html), we check that each model converges (`check_convergence()`), plot diagnostics, results, and reference points (`plot_wham_output()`), and compare models using AIC and Mohn's rho (`compare_wham_models()`).

## 1. Prepare `wham`

Open R and load the `wham` package:

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(wham)
```
```{r, include = FALSE}
is.repo <- try(pkgload::load_all(compile=FALSE)) #this is needed to build the vignettes without the new version of wham installed.
if(is.character(is.repo)) library(wham) #not building webpage
#note that if plots are not yet pushed to the repo, they will not show up in the html.
wham.dir <- find.package("wham")
```

For a clean, runnable `.R` script, look at `ex2_CPI_recruitment.R` in the `example_scripts` folder of the `wham` package.
You can run this entire example script with:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
wham.dir <- find.package("wham")
source(file.path(wham.dir, "example_scripts", "ex2_CPI_recruitment.R"))
```

Let's create a directory for this analysis:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# choose a location to save output, otherwise will be saved in working directory
write.dir <- "choose/where/to/save/output" #e.g., tempdir(check=TRUE)
dir.create(write.dir)
setwd(write.dir)
```

```{r, eval = FALSE, include=FALSE}
write.dir <- tempdir(check=TRUE)
setwd(write.dir)
```
WHAM was originally built by modifying the ADMB-based ASAP model code [(Legault and Restrepo 1999)](http://sedarweb.org/docs/wsupp/S12RD06%20ASAPdoc.pdf), and is designed to take an ASAP3 .dat file as input. We generally assume in `wham` that you have an existing ASAP3 .dat file. If you are not familiar with ASAP3 input files, see the ASAP [documentation](https://github.com/cmlegault/ASAPplots/tree/master/pdf) and [code](https://nmfs-fish-tools.github.io/ASAP/). For this vignette, an example ASAP3 input file is provided, `ex2_SNEMAYT.dat`. We will also need a data file with an environmental covariate, the Cold Pool Index, `CPI.csv`.

Read in `ex2_SNEMAYT.dat` and `CPI.csv` to R:
```{r eval=FALSE}
wham.dir <- find.package("wham")
asap3 <- read_asap3_dat(file.path(wham.dir,"extdata","ex2_SNEMAYT.dat"))
env.dat <- read.csv(file.path(wham.dir,"extdata","CPI.csv"), header=T)
```
```{r include=FALSE}
path_to_examples <- system.file("extdata", package="wham")
env.dat <- read.csv(file.path(path_to_examples,"CPI.csv"), header=T)
```
We generally abbreviate 'environmental covariate' as `ecov` in the code. In this example, the `ecov` data file has columns for observations (`CPI`), standard error (`CPI_sigma`), and year (`Year`). Observations and year are always required. Standard error can be treated as fixed/data with yearly values (as here) or one overall value shared among years. It can also be estimated as a parameter(s), likewise either as yearly values or one overall value.
```{r}
head(env.dat)
```

## 2. Specify models

Now we specify how the 7 models treat recruitment, the CPI process, and how the CPI affects recruitment:
```{r}
Ecov_how <- paste0(
  c("none", "controlling-", "none", "limiting-", "limiting-", "controlling-", "controlling-"), 
  c("", "lag-1-", "", rep("lag-1-",4)),
  c("", "linear", "", rep("linear", 4)))

df.mods <- data.frame(Recruitment = c(2,2,3,3,3,3,4),
                      Ecov_process = c(rep("rw",4),rep("ar1",3)),
                      Ecov_how = Ecov_how, stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
n.mods <- dim(df.mods)[1]
df.mods$Model <- paste0("m",1:n.mods)
df.mods <- dplyr::select(df.mods, Model, tidyselect::everything()) # moves Model to first col
```

Look at the model table. The `Ecov_how` is a a more recent character string approach to defining environmental effects on recruitment.
```{r}
df.mods
```

We specify the options for modeling recruitment and any environmental covariate(s) using the `prepare_wham_input()` function. WHAM provides 4 options for recruitment (`recruit_model`): 

  1. random walk, 
  2. random about mean, 
  3. Beverton-Holt, and 
  4. Ricker.

The environmental covariate options are fed to `prepare_wham_input()` as a list, `ecov`:
```{r eval=FALSE}
  m=1 # example for first model
  ecov <- list(
    label = "CPI",
    mean = as.matrix(env.dat$CPI),
    logsigma = as.matrix(log(env.dat$CPI_sigma)),
    year = env.dat$Year,
    use_obs = matrix(1, ncol=1, nrow=dim(env.dat)[1]), # use all obs (=1)
    process_model = df.mods$Ecov_process[m], # "rw" or "ar1"
    recruitment_how = matrix(df.mods$Ecov_how[m],1,1)) #matrix for number of stocks (1) and number of Ecovs (1)
```

There are currently 2 options for the `ecov` process model (`ecov$process_model`): 1) random walk (`'rw'`), and 2) autoregressive (`'ar1'`). Recent versions of WHAM now specify effects of covariates on recruitment, natural mortality, catchability, and movement using character strings. For recruitment we specify **recruitment_how** for the mechanistic affect on recruitment, the time lag between the covariate and recruitment, and the order of the orthogonal polynomial effect. The options for the mechanistic effect follow [Iles and Beverton (1998)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1385110197000221) and [Xu et al. (2018)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/fog.12236): 

  1. "controlling" (density-independent mortality), 
  2. "limiting" (carrying capacity, e.g. `ecov` determines amount of suitable habitat), 
  3. "lethal" (threshold, i.e. R --> 0 at some `ecov` value),  
  4. "masking" (metabolic/growth, `ecov` decreases dR/dS), and 
  5. "directive" (e.g., behavioral). 
  
In `Ecov_how` we specify the **lag** of 1 for the CPI so that CPI in year *t* affects recruitment in year *t + 1*. We also specify a first order polynomial ("linear" or "poly-1"). For no effect of the covariate, but still keeping the state-space model estimation for the covariate, `Ecov_how`= "none".

You can set `ecov = NULL` or `process_model`= NA to fit the model without environmental covariate data, but note that here we fit the `ecov` data even for models without an `ecov` effect on recruitment (`m1` and `m3`) so that we can compare them via AIC (need to have the same data in the likelihood).

Options are described in the `set_ecov` help page. Not all mechanistic effects options are implemented for every recruitment model.
```{r eval=FALSE}
?set_ecov
```

## 3. Run the models

```{r eval=FALSE}
for(m in 1:n.mods){
  # set up environmental covariate data and model options
  ecov <- list(
    label = "CPI",
    mean = as.matrix(env.dat$CPI),
    logsigma = as.matrix(log(env.dat$CPI_sigma)),
    year = env.dat$Year,
    use_obs = matrix(1, ncol=1, nrow=dim(env.dat)[1]), # use all obs (=1)
    process_model = df.mods$Ecov_process[m], # "rw" or "ar1"
    recruitment_how = matrix(df.mods$Ecov_how[m],1,1)) #matrix for number of stocks (1) and number of Ecovs (1)

  # (not used in this vignette) can set ecov = NULL to fit model without ecov data
  if(is.na(df.mods$ecov_process[m])) ecov = NULL 

  # generate wham input from ASAP3 and ecov data
  input <- prepare_wham_input(asap3, recruit_model = df.mods$Recruitment[m],
                              model_name = "Ex 2: SNEMA Yellowtail Flounder with CPI effects on R",
                              ecov = ecov,
                              NAA_re = list(sigma="rec+1", cor="iid"),
                              age_comp = "logistic-normal-pool0") # logistic normal pool 0 obs
  
  # Selectivity = logistic, not age-specific as in ex1
  #   2 pars per block instead of n.ages
  #   sel pars of indices 4/5 fixed at 1.5, 0.1 (specified via neg phase in ex2_SNEMAYT.dat)
  input$par$logit_selpars[1:4,7:8] <- 0 # last 2 rows will not be estimated (mapped to NA)

  # Fit model
  mod <- fit_wham(input, do.retro=TRUE, do.osa=TRUE)

  # Save model
  saveRDS(mod, file=paste0(df.mods$Model[m],".rds"))

  # Plot output in new subfolder
  plot_wham_output(mod=mod, dir.main=file.path(getwd(),df.mods$Model[m]), out.type='html')
}
```

## 4. Check for convergence

```{r include=FALSE}
data(vign2_conv)
data(vign2_res)
```

Collect all models into a list.
```{r eval=FALSE}
mod.list <- paste0(df.mods$Model,".rds")
mods <- lapply(mod.list, readRDS)
```

We need to check that the models converged. The maximum absolute gradient should be very close to 0 and SE estimates should be calculable (invertible Hessian, `TMB::sdreport()` succeeds). All models seem to have converged and have a positive definite Hessian.
```{r eval=FALSE}
vign2_conv <- lapply(mods, function(x) capture.output(check_convergence(x)))
for(m in 1:n.mods) cat(paste0("Model ",m,":"), vign2_conv[[m]], "", sep='\n')
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
for(m in 1:7) cat(paste0("Model ",m,":"), vign2_conv[[m]], "", sep='\n')
```

## 5. Compare models

Let's first make the results table prettier.
```{r eval=FALSE}
df.mods$Recruitment <- dplyr::recode(df.mods$Recruitment, `2`='Random', `3`='Bev-Holt', `4`='Ricker')
df.mods$Ecov_how <- c("---", "Controlling", "---", "Limiting", "Limiting", "Controlling", "Controlling")
```

Now get the convergence information.
```{r eval=FALSE}
opt_conv = 1-sapply(mods, function(x) x$opt$convergence)
ok_sdrep = sapply(mods, function(x) if(x$na_sdrep==FALSE & !is.na(x$na_sdrep)) 1 else 0)
df.mods$conv <- as.logical(opt_conv)
df.mods$pdHess <- as.logical(ok_sdrep)
df.mods$NLL <- sapply(mods, function(x) round(x$opt$objective,3))
```

Only calculate AIC and Mohn's rho for converged models.
```{r eval=FALSE}
not_conv <- !df.mods$conv | !df.mods$pdHess
mods2 <- mods
mods2[not_conv] <- NULL
df.aic.tmp <- as.data.frame(compare_wham_models(mods2, table.opts=list(sort=FALSE, calc.rho=T))$tab)
df.aic <- df.aic.tmp[FALSE,]
ct = 1
for(i in 1:n.mods){
  if(not_conv[i]){
    df.aic[i,] <- rep(NA,5)
  } else {
    df.aic[i,] <- df.aic.tmp[ct,]
    ct <- ct + 1
  }
}
df.mods <- cbind(df.mods, df.aic)
df.mods <- df.mods[order(df.mods$dAIC, na.last=TRUE),]
df.mods[is.na(df.mods$AIC), c('dAIC','AIC','rho_R','rho_SSB','rho_Fbar')] <- "---"
rownames(df.mods) <- NULL
```

Print and save the results table. `m6` has the lowest AIC (Bev-Holt recruitment, CPI modeled as AR1, controlling effect of CPI on recruitment), but `m5` and `m7` have similar AIC values.
```{r eval=FALSE}
save("df.mods", file="vign2_res.RData")
df.mods
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
vign2_res
```

## 6. Results

There are various options for creating WHAM output. The default is to create a self-contained html file using Rmarkdown and individual plot files (.png) that are organised within subdirectories of `plots_png`. The html file also includes tables of estimates for fundamental parameters and abundance and fishing mortality at age. On Windows you may need to use Chrome or Internet Explorer to view the `.html` (there have been issues using Firefox on Windows but not Linux).
```{r eval=FALSE}
# save output plots in subfolder for each model
for(m in 1:n.mods) plot_wham_output(mod=mods[[m]], dir.main=file.path(getwd(), df.mods$Model[m]), out.type='html')
```

### Cold Pool Index (CPI)

Models that included an effect of the Cold Pool Index on recruitment were strongly supported by AIC over models without CPI effects (`m2` and `m4-7` lower AIC than `m1` and `m3`). Note that we can compare models with and without a CPI effect on recruitment using AIC because we also fit the CPI data in the models without the effect (`m1` and `m3`).

Comparing `m4` and `m5` demonstrates that the CPI was best modeled as an AR1 process (`m5`) instead of a random walk (`m4`), since this was the only difference between the two models and `m5` had lower AIC. The one-step-ahead residuals for the CPI from `m5` (right) are similar in distribution. The linear trend in the OSA residuals with observed value for `m5` is due to the best prediction of the next observation being near the mean of the process in this case because the estimated autocorrelation parameter is near 0:

As we saw from the table of results, all the models produced similar Mohn's $\rho$ values for SSB, F, and recruitment. Below are the relative retrospective peels for the model without any SSB or CPI effects on recruitment (`m1`, left) and the best model that included CPI and SSB effects on recruitment, (`m6`, right).

### Recruitment

A Beverton-Holt stock-recruitment assumption was preferred over random recruitment (`m3` lower AIC than `m1`). Models that included both Bev-Holt and CPI effects on recruitment had lower AIC than the model with Bev-Holt but without the CPI (`m4` vs. `m3`). Adding the CPI effect to the Bev-Holt explains some of the variability around the stock-recruit curve, which resulted in `m4` (right) estimating lower $\sigma_R$ than `m3` (left).

### Stock status

Whether or not to include a stock-recruit function and/or the CPI did not have a great influence on estimated stock status using SPR-based reference points. Specifically, the models hardly differed in their estimation of the probability that the stock was overfished, $Pr[SSB < 0.5 \: SSB_{40\%}]$. All models estimated with 100% probability that the stock was not experiencing overfishing in 2011, $F < F_{40\%}$.

When determined relative MSY-based reference points, status is more optimistic:
